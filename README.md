### Do not use periods at the end of bulleted lists unless they are complete sentences

Individual list items following a complete sentence are usually capitalized but appear without terminal punctuation (i.e., they donâ€™t end in a period, comma, colon, or semicolon) if they are incomplete sentences, phrases, or single words.

If the list is introduced with a complete sentence, that sentence should be punctuated with a colon or period.
